## Lab 8: Observable Click Counter

This project contains starter code for adding observers and views
to a simple click counter.  It shows:

* How to apply the observer pattern
* How to dependency injection
* How to create JavaFX FXML interfaces and get a reference to their controller, so we can perform dependency injection or apply the observer pattern.
